# Tournament Simulation Guide

This folder contains resources to help you simulate the tournament workflow in TournaNet.

## 1. Automated Base Data (Prisma Seeding)
The most comprehensive way to populate the project with simulation data is via the built-in Prisma seed script. This generates:
- **Users**: Admin (`admin@tournanet.app`) and Scorer (`scorer@tournanet.app`) accounts (Password: `admin123`/`scorer123`).
- **Schools**: 5 sample schools from different districts.
- **Events**: A mix of TRACK and FIELD events scheduled for **Yesterday**, **Today**, and **Tomorrow**.
- **Athletes**: ~40 athletes registered and assigned to events.
- **Results**: Automated results for "Yesterday's" events to populate the Scoreboard history.

### How to run:
```bash
cd apps/api
npx prisma db seed
```

## 2. Manual Data Reference (CSVs)
If you want to test manual entry or reference the data structure, we have provided several sample files:

- **`sample_schools.csv`**: A list of 5 major schools with district and contact info. Use this to manually create schools or for bulk reference.
- **`sample_events.csv`**: Configuration for TRACK and FIELD events across different categories and dates.
- **`sample_athletes.csv`**: Use this for the **Bulk Athlete Import** feature in the Admin Dashboard.
- **`sample_results_entry.csv`**: A reference sheet for a Scorer to use when entering live results (contains bib numbers and sample times/marks).

## 3. Bulk Athlete Import Simulation
To simulate a real-world registration from a school:
1. Log in to the Admin Dashboard.
2. Go to the **Athletes** section.
3. Click "Import CSV".
4. Upload `sample_athletes.csv`.
   - **Note**: You must replace the `schoolId` column values with actual UUIDs from your `schools` table in your local Postgres instance.

## 4. Scorer Simulation
To simulate live scoring:
1. Log in as `scorer@tournanet.app`.
2. View events scheduled for "Today" (generated by the seed script).
3. Enter results for heats and watch the **Public Scoreboard** update in real-time.
